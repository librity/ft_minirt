# ChatGPT - Normal Rotation

To rotate a plane so that it is oriented based on a normal vector, you can follow these steps:
    - [x] Determine the current normal vector of the plane. You can do this by taking the cross product of two non-parallel vectors in the plane.

    - [x] Calculate the angle between the current normal vector and the desired normal vector. You can use the dot product of the two vectors to do this:
        cos(theta) = (current normal vector) . (desired normal vector) / (magnitude of current normal vector) * (magnitude of desired normal vector)
        theta = acos(cos(theta))

    - [x] Calculate the axis of rotation. This can be done by taking the cross product of the current normal vector and the desired normal vector.

    - [x] Construct a rotation matrix using the axis-angle representation of the rotation. The axis-angle representation specifies the axis of rotation and the angle of rotation. The formula to construct the rotation matrix is:
        R = cos(theta) * I + (1 - cos(theta)) * (axis of rotation) * (axis of rotation)^T + sin(theta) * skew-symmetric matrix(axis of rotation)
        where I is the identity matrix and the skew-symmetric matrix of a vector v is:
        [0 -vz vy]
        [vz 0 -vx]
        [-vy vx 0]
        where vx, vy, and vz are the components of v.

    - [x] Apply the rotation matrix to each point in the plane to rotate it into the desired orientation.

Note that this assumes that the plane is centered at the origin. If the plane is not centered at the origin, you will need to translate it to the origin, apply the rotation, and then translate it back to its original position.
