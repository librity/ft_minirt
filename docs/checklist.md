# - [x] Mandatory

- [x] Don't turn in libs as submodules.
- [x] Migrate `ft_libbmp` to `minirt.h`.
- [x] Makefile should explicitly name all source files (`make dump_sources`).
- [x] Make must compile without relinking
  - [x] `make all` shouldn't recompile/rearchive any objects or sources.
  - [x] Add `.keep` to object dirs
  - [X] Create non-phony rule for each lib archive
- [x] Test in workspaces
- [x] Compiles with workspace's `cc` (`clang` version `12.0.1`)
  - [x] Switch Makefile's `clang-12` to `CC` before submitting.
- [x] Program name `miniRT`
- [x] Follows `norminette 3.3.51`
- [x] Makefile rules: `$(NAME)` `all` `clean` `fclean` `re` `bonus`
- [x] Make must compile without relinking
- [x] `Makefile` must not relink
- [x] Compiles with `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`
- [x] Should not quit unexpectedly (segmentation fault, bus error, double free, etc.)
- [x] All allocated heap memory properly freed, no memory leaks.
  - [x] Use gcc `-fsanitize=leak` flag.
  - [x] Check memory leaks with `valgrind`.
- [x] Turn in `Makefile`, `*.h`, `*.c`, `.gitignore`
- [x] Allowed functions:
  - [x] `open`, `close`, `read`, `write`, `printf`, `malloc`, `free`, `perror`, `strerror`, `exit`
  - [x] All `math.h`
  - [x] All `mlx.h`
  - [x] All `libft.h`
- [x] Create demo projects with miniLibX to see how it works
- [x] Load scene from `.rt` file
  - [x] Validate file name: `*.rt`
  - [x] Validate `.rt` file format
  - [x] Validate normalized vectors
  - [x] Skip comment lines (`#`)
  - [x] Ambient lightning: `A NORMALIZED_BRIGHTNESS RED,GREEN,BLUE`
  - [x] Camera: `C X,Y,Z OX,OY,OZ HORIZONTAL_FIELD_OF_VIEW`
    - [x] Use a different up vector when orientation is also up.
  - [x] Light: `L X,Y,Z NORMALIZED_BRIGHTNESS RED,GREEN,BLUE`
  - [x] Sphere: `sp X,Y,Z DIAMETER RED,GREEN,BLUE`
  - [x] Plane: `pl X,Y,Z OX,OY,OZ RED,GREEN,BLUE`
  - [x] Cylinder: `cy X,Y,Z OX,OY,OZ DIAMETER HEIGHT RED,GREEN,BLUE`
- [x] Create Vectors functions
- [x] Create Linear Algebra functions

- [x] Objects
  - [x] Spheres
  - [x] Planes
  - [x] Cylinders
  - [x] Correctly handle object intersections
  - [x] Correctly handle object inside
- [x] Create a user interface with `MiniLibX`
  - [x] Use `MiniLibX` â€™s images
  - [x] Window management must remain smooth
  - [x] Close window button exits the program cleanly
  - [x] `esc` key exits the program cleanly
  - [x] Refresh image so it doesn't disappear on the VNC when window is minimized

# - [ ] Bonus

- [x] Add specular reflection to have a full Phong reflection model.
- [ ] One other 2nd degree object
  - [ ] Cone
  - [ ] Hyperboloid
  - [ ] Paraboloid
- [ ] Color disruption: checkerboard.
- [ ] Colored and multi-spot lights.
- [ ] Handle bump map textures.
- [ ] Save trace to `.bmp` file
  - [ ] `s` key saves the image
